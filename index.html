        Letters for Action is an initiative which aims to streamline the process of letter writing for allies in support of the black community, the messages of black activists, and the Black Lives Matter Movement.  Our platform strives to add convenience to the letter writing process by providing templates, designating stakeholders to receive letters, and eliminating the middle step of having to send the letter yourself.
