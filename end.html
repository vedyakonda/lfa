          . I am emailing you today on behalf of the George Floyd case. 
          <br><br>
          As a non-black person of color, I am speaking from a unique position of privilege. The ability to absolve oneself from feeling and being complicit in antiblack violence by asserting “I am not white” is certainly not a solution here. Thus, I am calling for the prosecution of Derek Chauvin #1087 and his partner Tou Thao #7162 to the fullest extent of the law and I will not rest until that happens. George Floyd was arrested under an implied, non-violent crime and bystanders and video footage bolster the fact that he never resisted his arrest. The approach that the officers chose to take was one that resulted in murder and must not be taken lightly.  
          <br><br>
          I urge you to utilize your privileged platform to push for justice and take strides to reimagine a devastatingly broken system. For seven minutes, George Floyd and bystanders cried out and pleaded for his life as your officers choked him to death in broad daylight. This is an act of police violence committed on an innocent, unarmed black man. No one deserves what happened to George and millions of other innocent black men and women. This was a racist hate crime and severe abuse of power. However, incremental change is in your hands. It’s up to you to grant justice.

          —I am your constituent. I am emailing you today on behalf of the George Floyd case and the millions of innocent Black lives that have been taken without remorse or any consequences. As a non-black person of color, I am speaking from a unique position of privilege. The ability to absolve oneself from feeling and being complicit in antiblack violence by asserting “I am not white” is certainly not a solution here. However, while the murder of Floyd occured in Minneapolis, the racism intrinsic to the police system infiltrates even precincts in your district. Acts of police violence committed on innocent, unarmed black people are all too common and we need your support to help create a safer community one district at a time. While non-black people of color in your district do not feel the same peril simply walking down the street, it is Black Americans during the Civil Rights movement who used protests and civil disobedience to reform racist immigration entry quotas and legal barriers. Their activism gave us liberty which we, every day, take for granted. Our very presence in this country is inextricably linked to the work of Black activists. And the way we, specifically police officers, take advantage of their decades of suffering only to abuse and casually end their lives is certainly not okay and never will be. I urge you to utilize your privileged platform, especially if you too identify as a non-black person of color, to push for justice and take strides to reimagine a devastatingly broken system. No one deserves what happened to George and millions of other innocent black men and women. This was a racist hate crime and severe abuse of power. However, incremental change is in your hands.
